So, there is no way to connect 2 devices behind CGN without 3rd party tools.
UPnP won't work because it uses multicast, basically. It doesn't go upstream all the way to ISP router.
Also, ISP probably doesn't support UPnP. 
Port forwarding without Public IP is impossible (as I figured out)

Tailscale, Wireguard - solutions for connecting systems.
