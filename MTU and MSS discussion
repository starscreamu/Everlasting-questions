So, Ethernet Frame is 1518 bytes with 14 bytes header and 4 bytes FCS. Any more than that are Jumbo frames. Or if less than 64 bytes are runt frames.
Actual payload is 1500, obviously. And 48 when frame is 64.
TCP has a limit called Maximum Segment Size, or MSS. This is the size of the layer-4 payload (without the IP and TCP headers).
If you set MTU i.e 1400 for a tunnel, the workstation (Win or Linux machine i.e) doesn't know about the 1400 bytes of the tunnel and sends big packets anyway (1500 by default in most cases). 
So option is to use Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).



####ENCAPSULATION OVERHEAD####
Okay, why change MTU from 1500 to i.e 1400? Because of the encapsulation overhead. 

PPPoE needs additional 8 bytes. Because IP MTU is 1492 now, so it gives space for a header for it not get fragmented (IPSec, GRE...).

In PPPoE MTU is 1492 because of 8 bytes of PPP encapsulation. 1500 - 8 = 1492. Simple.
GRE (IP Protocol 47) (RFC 2784) adds 24 bytes (20 byte IPv4 header, 4 byte GRE header).
IPsec encryption performed by the DMVPN adds 73 bytes for ESP-AES-256 and ESP-SHA-HMAC overhead.


Basically, there's no problem in fragmenting the packet, the problem is to get the packet back together. It needs additional resources.


#########################
The reason why you have to adjust MSS is because routers don't look at L4 information when forwarding packets.
So, if a host with MTU of 1500 sends a packet, it has an MSS of 1460, which exceeds the MSS 1452 the PPPoE can carry. So the packet is dropped.
